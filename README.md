# **SUTD 10.006 Chemistry and Biology: The Natural World 2019 Progressive Learning Worksheet Answers**

## Motivation

As the instructors do not provide any official answers (except for a few questions), I have decided to compile my own. The questions are uploaded on eDimension. Since these worksheet questions are only for practice and not officially graded, I feel that it is fine for me to upload the answers here.

## DISCLAIMER

This repository contains suggested answers (personally done by myself) for the Progressive Learning Worksheet Questions. There could be a possibility of mistakes being made (as I am an imperfect human). Please notify me about any corrections. I only provide final answers for checking here. For further working and steps necessary to get the actual marks during the examinations, please consult your instructor (or me, if I have some free time).

I hope that this can be of assistance. All the best for your 10.006 examinations!
